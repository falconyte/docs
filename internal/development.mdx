## Working agreements

<Info>
  Keep these notes team-internal. Nothing in this file is published to the public docs site.
</Info>

- Open a feature branch for every docs change.
- Keep pull requests small and focused on a single topic whenever possible.
- Include screenshots in PR descriptions when you update or add imagery.
- Ask the docs channel in Slack when you need historical context.

## Local feedback loop

1. Clone the repository fresh or pull the latest `main`.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install` (Node 20 LTS or higher recommended).
3. Use your preferred MDX preview tooling (VS Code + MDX extension works best).
4. Run `npm run lint` before opening a pull request.

> We rely on automated preview deploys from GitHub. If you need an ad-hoc preview, open a draft PR and the pipeline will attach a link.

## Deployment flow

- Merges to `main` trigger an automated deployment to `https://docs.falconyte.dev/`.
- The docs site typically updates within a few minutes once the CI checks pass.
- If the pipeline fails, check the GitHub Actions logs and ping the Platform channel.

## Style checklist

- Confirm every page includes frontmatter (`title`, `description`, optional `icon`).
- Prefer internal links that match the current navigation hierarchy.
- Reuse snippets from `snippets/` when possible to keep terminology consistent.
- Compress large images before committing them; aim for <400KB whenever possible.

## Helpful tools

- VS Code extensions:
  - [MDX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx)
  - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- AI assistants configured in `/ai-tools` help keep tone and structure consistent.

## Troubleshooting

- `npm install` fails: clear `node_modules`, delete any local lockfile, and reinstall.
- Preview deploy missing updates: ensure the MDX file is referenced in `docs.json`.
- Broken internal links: run a search for the slug in `docs.json` and update paths.
- Persistent build failures: contact the docs platform owner or email [support@falconyte.com](mailto:support@falconyte.com).
