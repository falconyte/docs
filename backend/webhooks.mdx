Falconyte webhooks deliver notifications for contact activity, campaign events, and platform automations. All endpoints live under `/public/v1/webhooks` and require a valid team API key.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/public/v1/webhooks` | List webhooks for the authenticated team (paginated). |
| `POST` | `/public/v1/webhooks` | Create a webhook. |
| `GET` | `/public/v1/webhooks/{id}` | Retrieve a single webhook. |
| `PATCH` | `/public/v1/webhooks/{id}` | Update URL, events, enablement, or source. |
| `DELETE` | `/public/v1/webhooks/{id}` | Remove a webhook. |
| `POST` | `/public/v1/webhooks/{id}/enable` | Enable delivery. |
| `POST` | `/public/v1/webhooks/{id}/disable` | Pause delivery without deleting. |
| `GET` | `/public/v1/webhooks/{id}/deliveries` | Paginated delivery history with response codes. |
| `POST` | `/public/v1/webhooks/simulate` | Trigger a test event to validate receivers. |

## Create a webhook

1. Open the Falconyte dashboard and go to **Developer Tools → Webhooks**.
2. Choose **Create webhook** and select the events you wish to monitor.
3. Copy the generated secret; you will need it to verify signatures.

To create webhooks programmatically:

```bash
curl https://api.falconyte.com/public/v1/webhooks \
  -H "x-api-key: ${FALCONYTE_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com/falconyte-events",
    "events": ["email.contact.saved", "email.sent"],
    "source": "n8n"
  }'
```

Response payloads include:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `secret` | Shared secret for verifying signatures. |
| `is_enabled` | Delivery status. Defaults to `true`. |
| `events` | Array of subscribed event names. See the event catalog in the API reference. |
| `source` | Optional integration owner. See below. |
| `locked` | Boolean indicating whether the webhook can be edited from the dashboard. |

> Webhook URLs must be HTTPS and publicly reachable. Falconyte enforces a maximum of **10 enabled webhooks** per team; exceeding the limit returns `422` with the `MAX_WEBHOOKS_EXCEEDED` error code.

## Integration-managed webhooks

Set the optional `source` attribute to lock a webhook:

- Accepted values: `n8n`, `zapier`, `make`, `internal`.
- When `source` is non-null, `locked` becomes `true` and the Falconyte dashboard prevents manual edits/deletes.
- Removing the field (or setting it to `null`) reopens the webhook for manual management.

You can create and manage locked webhooks in the dashboard via **Developer Tools → Webhooks**. Webhooks created from that page display their source and lock state.

## Simulation and deliveries

Use the simulation endpoint to fire a test payload without waiting for live data:

```bash
curl https://api.falconyte.com/public/v1/webhooks/simulate \
  -H "x-api-key: ${FALCONYTE_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"webhook_id": "uuid", "event": "email.sent"}'
```

Delivery history includes:

- Attempt timestamps and HTTP response codes
- Retry scheduling metadata
- Last successful delivery timestamp

This information is exposed via the `/deliveries` endpoint and in the Falconyte dashboard.

## Handling signatures

Each delivery includes:

- `X-FY-Signature`: `t=<unix_timestamp>, v1=<hmac>` where the HMAC is generated with SHA-256 using the webhook `secret` and the raw JSON body, prefixed by the timestamp.
- `X-FY-Origin`: always `webhook`, allowing receivers to reject spoofed traffic.

Validate signatures by recomputing the HMAC:

```php
[$timestampPart, $hashPart] = explode(', ', $signatureHeader);
$timestamp = (int) str_replace('t=', '', $timestampPart);
$received = str_replace('v1=', '', $hashPart);

$expected = hash_hmac('sha256', "{$timestamp}.{$payload}", $secret);
hash_equals($expected, $received);
```

Rotate secrets by disabling and re-enabling the webhook (a new secret is issued automatically).

## Error responses

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `401 Unauthorized` | Missing or invalid API key. |
| `404 Not Found` | Webhook does not belong to the authenticated team. |
| `422 Unprocessable Entity` | Validation failure (invalid URL, events array, exceeded active limit). |
| `429 Too Many Requests` | Rate limit exceeded; retry after the interval. |
