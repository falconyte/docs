The Falconyte public API (`/public/v1`) authenticates requests with **team API keys**. Each key maps to a team scope and inherits that team's permissions, throttles, and webhook quotas.

## Create a team API key

1. Sign in to the Falconyte dashboard.
2. Navigate to **Developer Tools → API Keys**.
3. Generate a new key or rotate an existing one.
4. Copy the token value — it is shown once and hashed at rest.

> Store the token securely. Falconyte retains only a SHA-256 hash for validation, so lost keys cannot be recovered.

## Send authenticated requests

Include the key in the `x-api-key` header. Requests without the header (or with an expired/rotated key) return `401 Unauthorized`.

```bash
curl https://api.falconyte.com/public/v1/ping \
  -H "x-api-key: ${FALCONYTE_API_KEY}"
```

Successful responses contain `{ "ok": true }`. This endpoint simply validates credentials; Ping does not reflect deeper service health. Expired keys return:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHENTICATED",
    "message": "Valid team API key required."
  }
}
```

## Key lifecycle

- Keys may have an optional `expires_at`; the backend rejects expired keys automatically.
- Every successful call updates `last_used_at` for auditing.
- Revoke a key from the dashboard to immediately block access (the hash comparison fails, returning 401).

## Testing locally

Use the ping endpoint to validate credentials without impacting contact data:

```bash
curl https://api.falconyte.com/public/v1/ping \
  -H "x-api-key: ${FALCONYTE_API_KEY}"
```

## Error handling

- `401 Unauthorized` — missing or invalid key.
- `403 Forbidden` — route-specific authorization failure (e.g., accessing another team's resources).
- `429 Too Many Requests` — rate limit exceeded; obey `Retry-After` headers and back off.

See the [API reference](/api-reference/introduction) for per-endpoint authentication notes and example payloads.
