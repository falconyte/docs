description: "Create an API key, choose an environment, and make your first Falconyte request."

Follow this guide to authenticate with Falconyte and verify connectivity in minutes.

## 1. Generate an API key

1. Sign in to the Falconyte dashboard.
2. Go to **Developer Tools → API Keys**.
3. Select **Create key**, provide a descriptive name, and copy the token shown once.
4. Store the token securely; treat it like a password.

> Each key inherits the permissions of your team. Revoke unused keys promptly to maintain security.

## 2. Pick an environment

| Environment | Base URL | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Production | `https://api.falconyte.com` | Live data, rate limits enforced. |

> A dedicated sandbox is not currently available. All examples use the production domain.

## 3. Verify your credentials

Use the `/public/v1/ping` endpoint to confirm the API key works. This endpoint returns a simple authorization check—it does not test downstream services.

```bash
curl https://api.falconyte.com/public/v1/ping \
  -H "x-api-key: ${FALCONYTE_API_KEY}"
```

Successful calls return:

```json
{ "ok": true }
```

Invalid or missing keys return a `401 Unauthorized` response containing an error object. See [API authentication](/backend/api-authentication) for error handling tips.

## 4. Explore key endpoints

| Use case | Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Credential validation | `GET /public/v1/ping` | Confirm that an API key is active before calling other endpoints. |
| Sync contacts | `POST /public/v1/email/contacts/upsert` | Upsert a single contact. |
| Bulk sync | `POST /public/v1/email/contacts/bulk-upsert` | Upsert up to 1,000 contacts in one request. |
| Manage webhooks | `POST /public/v1/webhooks` | Create or update outbound webhook notifications. |

Refer to the [API reference](/api-reference/introduction) for full schemas and response structures.

## 5. Call authenticated endpoints from code

JavaScript example:

```bash
curl https://api.falconyte.com/public/v1/email/contacts/upsert \
  -H "x-api-key: ${FALCONYTE_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "customer@example.com",
    "first_name": "Ada",
    "last_name": "Lovelace"
  }'
```

Python example:

```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.falconyte.com/public/v1/email/contacts/upsert",
    headers={
        "x-api-key": FALCONYTE_API_KEY,
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    json={
        "email": "customer@example.com",
        "first_name": "Ada",
        "last_name": "Lovelace",
    },
    timeout=10,
)
response.raise_for_status()
print(response.json())
```

All responses include an `ok` flag and relevant payload data.

## 6. Next steps

- Protect your credentials by restricting API keys to minimum required scopes.
- Subscribe to status notifications to stay informed about platform events.
- Dive into the [webhook guide](/backend/webhooks) to receive outbound events.
