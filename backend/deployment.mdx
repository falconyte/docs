Falconyte runs on redundant infrastructure designed for high availability. Use this guide to understand release cadence, environment access, and operational best practices.

## Environment profiles

| Environment | Purpose | Base URL | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Production | Live customer traffic | `https://api.falconyte.com` | Global CDN, full rate limits, monitored 24/7. |

> A hosted sandbox is not available right now. Reach out to [support@falconyte.com](mailto:support@falconyte.com) to discuss alternative testing options.

## Status & incident communication

- **Status page**: real-time availability, incident history, and scheduled maintenance windows. Subscribe to email or webhook notifications.
- **Release notes**: published for every major update with API changes, new headers, or response fields.
- **Maintenance**: announced at least 7 days in advance with expected impact (if any).

## Rate limiting & throughput

Falconyte enforces fair-use rate limits to protect platform stability. Exact thresholds depend on your plan:

- Sustained throughput: maintain consistent volumes rather than sharp spikes.
- Burstable workloads: contact support if you expect traffic surges (imports, migrations, etc.).
- Error code `429` includes a `Retry-After` header indicating when to retry.

## Security considerations

- All requests must use HTTPS; HTTP is rejected with a redirect.
- API keys can be scoped and rotated instantly from the dashboard.
- IP allowlists are available upon request; contact support to enable them.
- Webhook signatures (see [webhook lifecycle](/backend/webhooks)) prevent replay and tampering.

## Operational checklist

- Monitor the `/public/v1/ping` endpoint to track availability from your infrastructure.
- Log response codes and retry behavior to catch issues early.
- Use idempotency keys (available on select endpoints) when building asynchronous workflows.
- Coordinate release windows with Falconyte support if you operate regulated workloads.
