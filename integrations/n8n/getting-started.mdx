Falconyte's official n8n community node enables you to automate contact management, event tracking, and webhook integrations directly within your n8n workflows—no custom HTTP requests required.

## What is the Falconyte n8n Node?

The Falconyte n8n integration provides:

- **Action Node**: Manage contacts, submit events, handle unsubscribes, and control webhook lifecycles
- **Trigger Node**: Automatically receive real-time notifications from Falconyte via webhooks

All operations use your Falconyte API key for authentication and work seamlessly with n8n's visual workflow builder.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. **A Falconyte account** - [Sign up](https://app.falconyte.com) if you don't have one
2. **An n8n instance** - [Self-hosted](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/) or [n8n Cloud](https://n8n.io/cloud/)
3. **A Falconyte API key** - Generate one from your dashboard

## Installation

### From n8n Community Store

The easiest way to install the Falconyte node is directly from n8n:

1. Open your n8n instance
2. Go to **Settings → Community Nodes**
3. Click **Install a community node**
4. Enter: `n8n-nodes-falconyte`
5. Click **Install**

n8n will download and install the latest version automatically.

### Manual Installation (Self-Hosted)

If you're running a self-hosted n8n instance with npm:

```bash
cd ~/.n8n/nodes
npm install n8n-nodes-falconyte
```

Then restart your n8n instance to load the new nodes.

## Create a Falconyte API Key

To authenticate with Falconyte:

1. Log in to the [Falconyte Dashboard](https://app.falconyte.com)
2. Navigate to **Developer Tools → API Keys**
3. Click **Create API Key**
4. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "n8n Integration")
5. Copy the generated key immediately—it's only shown once

<Warning>
Store your API key securely. Falconyte only retains a hashed version, so lost keys cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

## Configure Credentials in n8n

After installing the node, set up your credentials:

1. In n8n, create a new workflow or open an existing one
2. Add a **Falconyte** or **Falconyte Trigger** node
3. Click **Create New Credentials**
4. Fill in the credential form:
   - **API Key**: Paste your Falconyte API key
   - **Base URL** (optional): Leave as default (`https://api.falconyte.com`) unless using a staging environment
5. Click **Test Connection** to verify

The connection test sends a request to `/public/v1/ping` to validate your credentials. A successful test confirms your API key is valid and has proper permissions.

## Your First Workflow

Let's create a simple workflow that adds a contact to Falconyte:

### Step 1: Add a Manual Trigger

1. Add a **Manual Trigger** node to start your workflow
2. This lets you test the workflow by clicking "Execute Workflow"

### Step 2: Add the Falconyte Node

1. Click the **+** button to add a new node
2. Search for **Falconyte** and select it
3. Configure the node:
   - **Credential**: Select your Falconyte credentials
   - **Resource**: Contact
   - **Operation**: Upsert
   - **Email**: Enter a test email (e.g., `test@example.com`)
   - **First Name**: John
   - **Last Name**: Doe

### Step 3: Execute and Verify

1. Click **Execute Workflow** at the bottom of the screen
2. Check the output panel—you should see the created/updated contact data
3. Verify in the Falconyte Dashboard under **Contacts**

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "contact": {
    "id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Quick Examples

### Submit an Event

Track custom events like leads or sales:

- **Resource**: Event
- **Operation**: Submit Event
- **Event Name**: `lead.created`
- **Email**: `{{$json.email}}`
- **Payload**: Custom data as JSON

### Unsubscribe a Contact

Remove contacts from your email list:

- **Resource**: Unsubscribe
- **Operation**: Unsubscribe
- **Email**: `user@example.com`
- **Reason** (optional): `user_request`

### Receive Webhook Events (Trigger)

Use the **Falconyte Trigger** node to react to events:

1. Add a **Falconyte Trigger** node
2. Select events to listen for (e.g., `email.opened`, `email.clicked`)
3. The trigger automatically creates and manages the webhook for you
4. Connect downstream nodes to process events

## Authentication Details

All requests include:

- **Header**: `x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY`
- **User-Agent**: `Falconyte-n8n/1.0`
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`

Your API key authenticates against the `/public/v1` namespace and inherits your team's permissions and rate limits.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Test Fails

**Error**: `401 Unauthorized` or `UNAUTHENTICATED`

- Verify your API key is correct and hasn't been revoked
- Check that the key hasn't expired (if you set an expiration date)
- Ensure the Base URL is correct (`https://api.falconyte.com`)

### Node Not Appearing

If the Falconyte node doesn't appear after installation:

1. Restart your n8n instance completely
2. Clear your browser cache
3. For self-hosted: verify the package is in `~/.n8n/nodes` or your custom nodes directory
4. Check the n8n logs for installation errors

### Rate Limiting

**Error**: `429 Too Many Requests`

- Your API key has hit rate limits
- Implement delays between operations using **Wait** nodes
- Consider upgrading your Falconyte plan for higher limits
